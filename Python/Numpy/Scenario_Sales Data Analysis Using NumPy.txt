üßæ Scenario: Sales Data Analysis Using NumPy
You are working as a data analyst for a chain of 10 retail stores. The company collected sales data for each store over the course of 30 days. The data is stored in a 10 x 30 NumPy array, where:

Each row represents a store (Store 1 to Store 10),

Each column represents a day (Day 1 to Day 30),

Each element is the sales amount (in dollars) for that store on that day.
