# Python, SQL & Machine Learning Scripts Repository 🚀

Welcome to the **Python, SQL & Machine Learning Scripts Repository**!  
This repository contains a comprehensive collection of Python, SQL, and Machine Learning scripts, ranging from beginner to advanced levels. Whether you're a student, educator, or developer looking to learn, teach, or reference key programming and data science concepts, you'll find helpful and structured code examples here.

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

- [`python/`](./python): Python scripts categorized by difficulty level.
- [`sql/`](./sql): SQL scripts for various use cases, also categorized by level.
- [`ml/`](./ml): Machine Learning algorithms and projects.

---

## 🐍 [`python/`](./python)

Each level contains standalone `.py` files covering:

- **Basic**  
  - Variables, loops, functions, conditionals, data types
- **Intermediate**  
  - File handling, error handling, OOP, modules, list/dict/set comprehensions
- **Advanced**  
  - Decorators, generators, multithreading, web scraping, APIs, data analysis

### ➕ Bonus:
- Clean code practices  
- Real-world mini projects  
- Script-level documentation

---

## 🗃️ [`sql/`](./sql)

Scripts are written in standard SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL compatible):

- **Basic**  
  - `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, `JOIN`
- **Intermediate**  
  - `UNION`, `CASE`, subqueries, constraints
- **Advanced**  
  - `CTE`, `window functions`, `stored procedures`, `triggers`, optimization techniques

### ➕ Bonus:
- Sample datasets  
- Use-case-driven queries (reporting, analytics, data manipulation)  
- Scenario-based exercises

---

## 🤖 [`Machine Learning/`](./Machine_Learning/)

Comprehensive implementations of key ML algorithms with clean, well-commented Python code:

### 🧠 Supervised Learning

- Linear Regression  
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- XGBoost  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Naive Bayes

### 🧩 Unsupervised Learning

- K-Means Clustering  
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

### 🧾 Recommender Systems

- Content-based filtering  
- Collaborative filtering (User-based and Item-based)

### ➕ Bonus:
- Data preprocessing and visualization  
- Jupyter notebooks for interactive learning  
- Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, ROC-AUC)  
- Project-ready code templates
