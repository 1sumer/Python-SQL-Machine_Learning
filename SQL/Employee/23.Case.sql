-- The CASE expression compares an expression to a set of expression (when_expression_1, when_expression_2, when_expression_3, â€¦) using the equality operator (=). If you want to use other comparison operators such as greater than (>), less than (<), etc., you use the searched CASE expression.
-- The CASE statement returns the result_1, result_2, or result_3 if the expression matches the corresponding expression in the WHEN clause.
-- If the expression does not match any expression in the WHEN clause, it returns the esle_result in the ELSE clause. The ELSE clause is optional.
-- If you omit the ELSE clause and the expression does not match any expression in the WHEN clause, the CASE expression returns NULL.
