-- To remove duplicate rows from a result set, you use the DISTINCT operator in the SELECT clause as follows:

-- If you use one column after the DISTINCT operator, the DISTINCT operator uses values in that column to evaluate duplicates.

-- If you use two or more columns, the DISTINCT will use the combination of values in those columns to evaluate the duplicate.

-- Note that the DISTINCT only removes the duplicate rows from the result set. It doesnâ€™t delete duplicate rows in the table.

-- If you want to select two columns and remove duplicates in one column, you should use the GROUP BY clause instead.
