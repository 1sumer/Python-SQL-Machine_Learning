-- INNER JOIN

-- Returns rows when there is a match in both tables.

-- Suppose, you have two tables: A and B.

-- Table A has four rows: (1,2,3,4) and table B has four rows: (3,4,5,6)

-- When table A joins with table B using the inner join, you have the result set (3,4) that is the intersection of table A and table B.

-- RIGHT JOIN & LEFT JOIN
-- LEFT OUTER JOIN
-- Returns all rows from the left table, with matched rows from the right table. Nulls if no match.

--Retrieves all rows from the left table and the matched rows from the right table.

-- The left join, however, returns all rows from the left table whether or not there is a matching row in the right table.

-- Suppose we have two tables A and B. The table A has four rows 1, 2, 3 and 4. The table B also has four rows 3, 4, 5, 6.

-- When we join table A with table B, all the rows in table A (the left table) are included in the result set whether there is a matching row in the table B or not.

-- Self JOin
-- Joins a table with itself, often used for hierarchy or relationships within same table.

-- We join a table to itself to evaluate the rows with other rows in the same table. To perform the self-join, we use either an inner join or left join clause.

-- Because the same table appears twice in a single query, we have to use the table aliases. The following statement illustrates how to join a table to itself.
