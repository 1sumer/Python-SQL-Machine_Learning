-- To limit the number of rows returned by a select statement, you use the LIMIT and OFFSET clauses.

-- In this syntax:

    --The LIMIT row_count determines the number of rows (row_count) returned by the query.

    --The OFFSET offset clause skips the offset rows before beginning to return the rows.

-- The OFFSET clause is optional. If you omit it, the query will return the row_count rows from the first row returned by the SELECT clause.

-- When you use the LIMIT clause, it is important to use an ORDER BY clause to ensure the order of rows in the result set.

-- Not all database systems support the LIMIT clause.
