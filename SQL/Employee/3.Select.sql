-- Introduction to SQL SELECT statement

-- The SQL SELECT statement selects data from one or more tables. The following shows the basic syntax of the SELECT statement that selects data from a single table.

USE EMPLOYEE;

-- In this syntax:

	-- First, specify a list of comma-separated columns from the table in the SELECT clause.
	-- Then, specify the table name in the FROM clause.

	-- When evaluating the SELECT statement, the database system evaluates the FROM clause first and then the SELECT clause. Itâ€™s like from a table, select data from these columns.

	-- The semicolon (;) is not part of a query. The database server uses it to separate two SQL statements.

	-- SQL is case-insensitive.
