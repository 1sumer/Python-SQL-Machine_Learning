-- 1. ROW_NUMBER() 
-- Give row numbers to employees per department
-- Assigns a unique sequential integer to rows within a partition, starting from 1.
-- No tie-handling: Even tied values get different row numbers.

SELECT

  employee_id, 
  first_name, 
  salary,

-- 2. RANK()
-- Ranks rows within a partition based on the ordering, with gaps for tied ranks.
-- If two employees tie for 1st, they both get rank 1, and the next gets rank 3.
-- RANK() assigns the same rank to tied rows, but skips subsequent ranks.

-- Handle ties in salaries

-- DENSE_RANK() by salary within each department
-- Ranks rows like RANK(), but without gaps for tied values.
-- If two employees tie for 1st, they both get rank 1, the next gets rank 2.
-- DENSE_RANK() assigns the same rank to tied rows, but does not skip subsequent ranks.

-- üèÅ `LAST_VALUE()` ‚Äì Last row value in the window
-- üîÑ Use frame: `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING` to get true last value.

-- **UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING**
/*The clause ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING is a frame specification used with window functions. 
It defines the range of rows (called the window frame) to consider for calculating the result of the window function.*/

-- UNBOUNDED PRECEDING: Refers to the first row of the partition.

-- UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING: Refers to the last row of the partition.

-- By default, some window functions (like LAST_VALUE()) do not return the true last value of the partition unless you explicitly define the frame.
